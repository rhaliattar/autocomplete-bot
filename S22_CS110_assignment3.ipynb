    "The most appropriate method is to create two separate classes for multiple reasons. Firstly, this allows us to differentiate between properties of individual nodes and trees. Indeed, here, nodes would have attributes such as the letters, the children and whether they are the end of a word and trees would have a root and a word list. However, if we only had a single node class, we would need to incorporate the tree attributes separately, which would decrease the code readability. Moreover, there will be issues with the root node because an empty Trie tree has a single empty root node, which would require additional code to always implement when using a single Node class (since a root cannot simply be an attribute of a Node). Lastly, by using two classes, we are allowing for much more code reusability. For example, the Node class could easily be reused for any other type of tree with only a few simple edits on relevant attributes necessary; or the general structure of the Trie class could be reused as most trees require similar insertion methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "> - Depending on your answer to question **A**, either implement a `Node` and a `Trie` class or implement a `Node` class. **Choose the corresponding code cell and delete the other one.**\n",
    "> - For your class(es), write `insert()` and `lookup()` methods, which will insert a word into the trie tree and look it up, respectively. Use the code skeleton and examine the specifications of its docstrings to guide you on the details of inputs and outputs to each method.\n",
    "> - If you are coding two classes, your Trie class should, upon initiation, create the root Node. If you are coding a single class, use an attribute to mark the root node.\n",
    "> - Finally, ensure that the trie can be initiated with a wordbank as an input. This means that a user can create a trie and feed it an initial set of words at the same time (like in the tests below), which will be automatically inserted into the trie upon its creation. Likely, this will mean that your `__init__()` has to make some calls to your `insert()` method.\n",
    "> - Several test cases have been provided for your convenience, and these include some, but not all, possible edge cases. If the implementation is correct, your code will pass all the tests. Note: there are several ways in which we can condense the text cleaning syntax that we have provided for you without repeating the method `replace()` multiple times. However, we are leaving it this way for clarity.\n",
    "> - In addition, create **at least three more tests** to demonstrate that your code is working correctly and **justify** why such test cases are appropriate."

    "- **Test 1 - Empty tree:** I wanted to check this case because, if a tree is empty (e.g. someone forgot to populate it), the code shouldn't break. Instead, it should simply look the word up in the empty tree and return False.\n",
    "- **Test 2 - Other Alphabet:** I decided to try using different characters (arabic here), as this implementation should work for any alphabet/list of characters.\n",
    "- **Test 3 - Inserting an entire list:** I believe that one should be able to use the insert function to insert an entire list of words (as that is simply more efficient). I therefore tested this in both arabic and english.\n",
    "- **Test 4 - Prefix:** I also tried the prefix test again (in both english and arabic) to ensure that even if a prefix is in the tree (and even if it is a word), but it is not in the word bank, it would not be considered a word.\n",
    "- **Test 5 - Mixed Alphabets:** Here, I tested whether the tree breaks if there are multiple alphabets within it (a case equivalent but more efficient to having two separate trees for each language). This is helpful because it occurs quite often that there are characters in essays, speeches, etc... that are outside of the 26 english letters (e.g. numbers).\n",
    "- **Test 6 - Capital letters:** Lastly, I tried capitalizing random letters in one of the words to make sure that it does not make any difference."

    "First, let's start by considering the complexity of these two methods theoretically. When inserting a word into a Trie tree, we create a node for each letter (or if a node for that letter already exists, we just link the rest of the letters to that node). Therefore, inserting a word that has $n$ letters will have a time complexity of $O(n)$. Similarly, when looking up a word of length $n$, we check each individual letter, so it will once again have a time complexity of $O(n)$. Comparing this to all the trees we have explored in this course, we can see that this makes sense because it follows the fact that all elementary tree operations have a time complexity of $O(h)$ where $h$ is the height of the tree. Indeed, a Trie tree stores individual letters in each node, therefore, its height will be determined by the length of the longest word stored in it. However, when inserting or looking up a word, we simply need to consider the nodes related to that word which might not necessarily involve the longest word. This raises the question that since the time complexity for these methods is the same as a simpler structure to implement such as a Binary Search Tree, why do we need to go through all the trouble of creating a Trie tree? Well, let's think about the way a BST would store words. We know that we need a quantitative way of comparing words since the placement of a node depends on its \"size.\" A way of doing this would be alphabetically, so if a word comes before its parent node in the alphabet, we would store it as its left child and vice versa. Notice that a node can only have a maximum of two children, while the maximum number of children in a Trie tree node is the total number of letters in the relevant alphabet (or alphabets). Therefore, a BST would be longer while a Trie tree would be wider, and since the time complexity of these methods relies on height, the Trie tree would be more efficient. Especially if we store an entire dictionary! According to the BBC, the english language has a total of 171,146 words and we know that the height of a **balanced** BST is $h = log(n)$ where $n$ is the total number of words $\\implies h = log(171,146) \\approx 18$. Therefore, the only time where the Trie tree would be less efficient is if we were looking for or inserting a word that has more than 18 letters, and there aren't many of those in the english language. So yes, there are cases where a Trie tree might be less efficient than a BST but these are rare, especially considering the fact that, in the english language, the average word length is 5 letters, so in the average case scenario, the Trie tree is the most efficient structure. What about space complexity though? While my knowledge is quite limited as this class usually focuses on time complexity, I personally find this interesting and therefore wanted to do some research. According to GeeksforGeeks, a Trie tree has a space complexity of \"$O(\\text{alphabet size}\\cdot \\text{key length}\\cdot \\text{N})$ where $N$ is the number of keys in Trie.\" However, a BST logically, has a space complexity of $O(n\\cdot \\text{average key length})$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. We can clearly see that, when looking at space, Trie trees are evidently less efficient. So the best choice really depends on whether we want to optimize time or space.\n",

    "Due to the fact that we must look through all the children nodes since this implementation is generalized to multiple alphabets, there is a nested for loop in my implementation which could affect the time complexity. If that was not the case and we simply used the english alphabet, we could make sure that the children attribute of a node would be a list of 26 lists, each for the letter it corresponds to in the alphabet. We would therefore check if the list represented by the current letter we are looking at is empty, which would guarantee constant time. I therefore decided to test this by creating a tree with 9 random words and seeing the time it takes to insert a 10th word and the time it takes to look for. The varying input size here is the word length, and we can see that these methods scale linearly with it, as expected (ignoring the weird spikes in the insert function), which means that my implementation was optimal (yay!)."

    "### Q3‚ÄîFind the $k$ most common words in a speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mathematically determine the overall connotation of a speech, you might want to compute which words are most frequently used and then run a sentiment analysis. To this end, add a method to your code, `k_most_common()` that will take as an input $k$, an integer, and return a list of the $k$ most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you‚Äôre confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "> - To complete this exercise, you don‚Äôt have to bother with resolving ties (for example, if $k = 1$, but there are two most common words with the same frequency, you can return either of them). You can consider resolving ties as an extra challenge and let us know if you believe you solved it.\n",
    "> - The test cell below downloads and preprocesses several real-world speeches, and then runs the k-most-common word analysis of them; your code should pass the tests. There are cleaner and more concise ways to write that testing code, but this way should be easily understandable. The tests contain the following speeches:\n",
    ">> - Mehreen Faruqi - Black Lives Matter in Australia: https://bit.ly/CS110-Faruqi\n",
    ">> - John F. Kennedy - The decision to go to the Moon: https://bit.ly/CS110-Kennedy\n",
    ">> - Martin Luther King Jr. - I have a dream: https://bit.ly/CS110-King\n",
    ">> - Greta Thunberg - UN Climate Summit message: https://bit.ly/CS110-Thunberg\n",
    ">> - Vaclav Havel - Address to US Congress after the fall of Soviet Union: https://bit.ly/CS110-Havel\n",
    "> - As usual, add at least **three** more tests, and **justify** why they are relevant to your code (feel free to find more speeches to start analysing too!).\n",
    "> - Again, copy-paste your previous code and adjust to this *new version*. Note that the method is indented on purpose.\n",
    "> - This task will probably require your nodes to store more information about the frequency of words inserted into the tree. One data structure that might be very useful to tackle the problem of traversing the tree and finding the most common words is heaps‚Äîyou **are** allowed to use the `heapq` library or another alternative for this task."

    "Your task is to create a new `autocomplete()` method for your class, which will take a string as an input, and return another string as an output. If the string is not present in the tree, the output will be the same as the input. However, if the string is present in the trie tree, your task is to find the most common word to which it is a prefix and return that word instead (this can still turn out to be itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "> - To make the task more interesting, use the test cell code to download and parse *The Complete Works of William Shakespeare*, and insert them into a trie. Your autocomplete should then pass the tests below. This is a *large* book, so the code might take a while to run...!\n",
    ">- As usual, add at least **three** more test cases, and explain why they are appropriate (you can use input other than Shakespeare for them).\n",
    "> - Make sure to include a minimum **100 word-summary critically evaluating** your autocomplete engine. How does it really work? Your critical reflection needs to precisely assess the role of the different data structures used by their algorithm and what is the overall complexity that the algorithm offers. Can we do better? If so, how and by how much?\n",
    "> - Again, depending on how you choose to implement it, your `autocomplete()` might make calls to other helper methods. However, make sure that `autocomplete()` is the method exposed to the user in order to pass the tests.)*\n",
    ">- *Note*: this is a manifestly frequentist approach to the problem, which is not the only method to solve this computational problem, and in many cases, not the ideal technique. However, if you were tasked with implementing something like [this](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) or [this](https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/autocomplete/), it might just be enough, so let‚Äôs give it a go. Good luck!*"

    "**#analogies:** At the start of the assignment, I was very confused about how trie trees worked. I therefore started thinking about potential analogies I could make with the trie properties that would help me with the python implementation. The best one I came up was thinking of the tree as hierarchical organization and the nodes as individuals that work for them. In these there is one CEO (root node), that has a bunch of people that work right below them, who each have a bunch of people that work right below them, etc... This therefore represents a tree structure. I then thought of words in Tries as tasks that can be completed. Some specific tasks need a specific number of people within a specific branch of the organization to be completed (e.g. Creating an Instagram post: the CEO tells the Marketing director about the purpose of the post, who tells a designer some ideas so that they can create it, but for another task like simply brainstorming ideas, we would not need the designer). This set up (while a bit odd) allowed me to create a physical representation of an abstract data structure and it helped immensely with the python implementation. For example, in the insert method, I thought about how one would insert a task in an organization: the CEO would first ask if there is a director with the knowledge for it, if no one does, they would hire someone new (add a new letter); but if someone does (first letter is already in the tree), they would then address their subteam to check who can help, etc... The lookup method would check if a task could be completed given the current employees. The k_most_common method would check the k tasks that are completed the most amount of times in a year for example. After giving it a few employees, the autocomplete method would return the task that they most commonly work on together. By thinking about it this way, I was able to solve these problems quite easily, as I had an idea of what it would look like in real life.\n",

    "**#heuristics:** When working on the autocomplete function, I used one specific heuristic that really helped me understand how to go about creating it: working backwards. As an example of an autocomplete bot, I thought of the suggested words above the keyboard when typing messages on a phone. I thought about how they would know to give me these options given the prefix I wrote, and realized that they must have a data base of everything I had written on my phone (creepy!), and when I wrote a prefix, the phone searched for the words I used the most that contain this prefix. I therefore realized that I should reuse the k_most_common function with k = 1 on the subtree rooted at the last letter of the prefix. While this seems relatively simple, by starting with something physical that I knew about and going backwards, I was able to come up with an algorithmic strategy to solve the problem at hand.\n",
